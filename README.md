Paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9225467

In order to perform the operation by the mobile robot, the autonomous and computer-controlled system provide the best solution for different applications. To cater to such needs, the web-based application and mobile app provide the vital role in operating robots and bring a new way of performing robotic tasks autonomously. The web-based application controlled robots can be used in different fields such as industrial, mining, medical, military operations, agriculture, and so on. In this paper, a web application for a mobile robot is designed to understand every aspect of the robot's functionality and all the necessary controls and visuals of sensor and actuator data by the user. A user interface and web application are being developed for determining obstacles along the pathway of the robot that can control internet-of-thing (IOT) enabled web applications and to stop and movement of the robotic vehicle. Web application based processed commands are to be transmitted to the control unit of the robot through wi-fi and this robot can be controlled through web application via mobile phone. The visualization of air quantity in the environment is also done using the IOT cloud that also facilitates storing data for analysis in the future.
